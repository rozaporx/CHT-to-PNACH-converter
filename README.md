# CHT-to-PNACH-converter
A simple and effective tool for converting CHT cheat files to   the PNACH format, commonly used for PlayStation 2 emulation,   including compatibility with Grim Doomer OPL
How to use the CHT to PNACH Converter

1. The 'cht_to_pnach_converter.exe' program is already in its own folder.

2. Create a new folder named 'cht_files' in this same directory.

3. Copy all of your .cht cheat files into the 'cht_files' folder.

4. Run the 'cht_to_pnach_converter.exe' program by double-clicking it.

5. The converted .pnach files will be created in a new folder named 'pnach_files', also in this directory.


NOTE* if it does not have the game CRC in the CHT file, it will default and rename the PNACH file by the Game ID
